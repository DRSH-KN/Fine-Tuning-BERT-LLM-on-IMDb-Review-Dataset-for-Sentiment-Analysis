The fine-tuning of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art language model, for sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset. The primary objective was to develop
a model capable of classifying movie reviews as positive or negative sentiments. The methodology involved preprocessing the IMDb dataset, tokenizing text reviews using the BERT tokenizer, and 
fine-tuning the BERT model for sequence classification. The findings indicate that the fine-tuned BERT model achieved commendable performance, accurately predicting sentiments with an accuracy of 
over 90%. 

Methodology:
1. Dataset Selection and Preprocessing:
IMDb Dataset: The IMDb dataset containing movie reviews was chosen. The dataset consists of textual reviews labeled with sentiments (positive or negative).
Data Preprocessing: Initial data preprocessing involved cleaning, formatting, and organizing the dataset. A subset of 20,000 records was selected to expedite the initial exploration and processing.
2. Tokenization and Data Preparation:
BERT Tokenizer: The BERT tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library was employed for tokenizing the text reviews. Tokenization was performed to convert the text data into numerical input suitable for the BERT model.
Label Encoding: Sentiment labels were converted into numeric format (0 for negative and 1 for positive) to align with model requirements.
3. Model Selection and Fine-Tuning:
BERT Model: The BERT-base-uncased pre-trained model was chosen for its effectiveness in capturing contextual information from textual data.
Fine-Tuning Strategy: The pre-trained BERT model was fine-tuned using the tokenized IMDb dataset. The objective was to train the model to predict sentiment polarity from text inputs.
Optimization: The AdamW optimizer and a linear learning rate scheduler were used for model optimization during fine-tuning. Hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size were tuned for optimal performance.
4. Model Evaluation:
Train-Validation Split: The dataset was split into training and validation sets (80%-20%) to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Training and Validation: The fine-tuned BERT model was trained over multiple epochs, evaluating performance on the validation set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Performance Metrics, Analysis, and Streamlit App Integration:
Evaluation Metrics: Quantitative assessment metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to evaluate the model's efficacy in sentiment classification.
Analysis: Post-evaluation, the model's strengths, weaknesses, and potential avenues for improvement were meticulously analyzed based on evaluation metrics and insights derived from predictions. Additionally,
the Streamlit application's integration further expanded the project's scope, allowing interactive usage and real-time sentiment analysis of movie reviews.
